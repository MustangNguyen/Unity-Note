[Metcalfe's Law on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law)

> In network theory, the value of a system grows as approximately the square of the number of users of the system.

This law is based on the number of possible pairwise connections within a system and is closely related to [[../Hacker Laws/Reed's Law|Reed's Law]]. Odlyzko and others have argued that both Reed's Law and Metcalfe's Law overstate the value of the system by not accounting for the limits of human cognition on network effects; see [[../Hacker Laws/Dunbar's Number|Dunbar's Number]].
