[Conway's Law on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)

This law suggests that the technical boundaries of a system will reflect the structure of the organisation.

If an organisation is built more around 'verticals' which are oriented around features or services, the software systems will also reflect this.
