[1% Rule on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture))

The 90-9-1 principle suggests that within an internet community such as a wiki, 90% of participants only consume content, 9% edit or modify content and 1% of participants add content.

Real-world examples:

- A 2014 study of four digital health social networks found the top 1% created 73% of posts, the next 9% accounted for an average of ~25% and the remaining 90% accounted for an average of 2% ([Reference](https://www.jmir.org/2014/2/e33/))
