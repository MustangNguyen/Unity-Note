[Hick's law on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law)

> Decision time grows logarithmically with the number of options you can choose from.
> 
> William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman

In the equation below, `T` is the time to make a decision, `n` is the number of options, and `b` is a constant which is determined by analysis of the data.

This law only applies when the number of options is _ordered_, for example, alphabetically. This is implied in the base two logarithm - which implies the decision maker is essentially performing a _binary search_. If the options are not well ordered, experiments show the time taken is linear.

This is has significant impact in UI design; ensuring that users can easily search through options leads to faster decision making.

A correlation has also been shown in Hick's Law between IQ and reaction time as shown in [Speed of Information Processing: Developmental Change and Links to Intelligence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022440599000369).
