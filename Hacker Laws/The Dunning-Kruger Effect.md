[The Dunning-Kruger Effect on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)

> If you're incompetent, you can't know you're incompetent... The skills you need to produce a right answer are exactly the skills you need to recognize what a right answer is.

The Dunning–Kruger effect is a theoretical cognitive bias which was described by David Dunning and Justin Kruger in a 1999 psychological study and paper. The study suggests that people with a low level of ability at a task are likely to overestimate their ability of the task. The proposed reason for this bias is that a sufficient _awareness_ of the complexity of a problem or domain is required for a person to be able to make an informed opinion of their capability to work in that domain.

The Dunning-Kruger effect has sometimes been used to describe a related, but not necessarily implied effect which could be described as "The less a person understands a domain, the more they are likely to believe they can easily solve problems in that domain, as they are more likely to see the domain as _simple_". This more general effect is highly relevant in technology. It would suggest that people who are less familiar with a domain, such as non-technical team members or less experienced team members, are more likely to _underestimate_ the effort required to solve a problem in this space.

As a person's understanding and experience in a domain grows, they may well encounter another effect, which is that they tend to _overestimate_ the ability of _others_ or _underestimate_ their own ability, as they are have become so experienced in the domain. In all cases these effects are _cognitive biases_. As with any bias, an understanding that it may be present will often be sufficient to help avoid the challenges — as when there is awareness of a bias, more inputs and opinions can be included to attempt to eliminate these biases. A closely related bias is that of [Illusory superiority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority).

Real-world examples:

- [Apple vs. FBI: Why This Anti-Terror Hawk Switched Sides](https://fortune.com/2016/03/10/apple-fbi-lindsay-graham/) - In 2016 Senator Lindsey Graham changed his stance on Apple creating a 'backdoor' in their encryption of devices. Initially Graham had been critical of Apple challenging a request to create a 'backdoor', which he saw as necessary to investigate potential terrorist plots. However, by Graham's own admission, as he learned more about the technical complexity of the domain, he realised that he had assumed it to be far more simple than he had realised, and that such a backdoor could have serious negative consequences. This could potentially be considered an example of the Dunning-Kruger effect - a cyber-security expert would likely understand immediately how such a backdoor could be exploited, as they have deep understanding of the domain, a layperson might assume that phone security is more similar to _physical security_ where the practice of having a 'master key' for law enforcement is possible, but this analogy does not apply sufficiently well to describe modern encryption in cyber-security.
