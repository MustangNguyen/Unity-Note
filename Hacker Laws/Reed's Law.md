[Reed's Law on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed's_law)

> The utility of large networks, particularly social networks, scales exponentially with the size of the network.

This law is based on graph theory, where the utility scales as the number of possible sub-groups, which is faster than the number of participants or the number of possible pairwise connections. Odlyzko and others have argued that Reed's Law overstates the utility of the system by not accounting for the limits of human cognition on network effects; seeÂ [[../Hacker Laws/Dunbar's Number|Dunbar's Number]].
