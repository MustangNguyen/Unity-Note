[All Models Are Wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong)

> All models are wrong, but some are useful.

This principle suggests that all models of systems are flawed, but that as long as they are not _too_ flawed they may be useful. This principle has its roots in statistics but applies to scientific and computing models as well.

A fundamental requirement of most software is to model a system of some kind. Regardless of whether the system being modeled is a computer network, a library, a graph of social connections or any other kind of system, the designer will have to decide an appropriate level of detail to model. Excessive detail may lead to too much complexity, too little detail may prevent the model from being functional.
