[The Shirky Principle explained](https://kk.org/thetechnium/the-shirky-prin/)

> Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution.
> 
> _Clay Shirky_

The Shirky Principle suggests that complex solutions - a company, an industry, or a technology - can become so focused on the problem that they are solving, that they can inadvertently perpetuate the problem itself. This may be deliberate (a company striving to find new nuances to a problem which justify continued development of a solution), or inadvertent (being unable or unwilling to accept or build a solution which solves the problem completely or obviates it).
