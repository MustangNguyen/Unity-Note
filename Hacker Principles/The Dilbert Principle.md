[The Dilbert Principle on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert_principle)

> Companies tend to systematically promote incompetent employees to management to get them out of the workflow.
> 
> _Scott Adams_

A management concept developed by Scott Adams (creator of the Dilbert comic strip), the Dilbert Principle is inspired by [[../Hacker Principles/The Peter Principle|The Peter Principle]]. Under the Dilbert Principle, employees who were never competent are promoted to management in order to limit the damage they can do. Adams first explained the principle in a 1995 Wall Street Journal article, and expanded upon it in his 1996 business book, [[../Hacker Principles/The Dilbert Principle|The Dilbert Principle]].
